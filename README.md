# Text-Summarization

Text summarization is one of the most interesting problems in NLP. Extracting the summary of a large text document manually is a difficult task.

To solve this problem, we use automatic text summarization. Itâ€™s a way of identifying meaningful information in a document and summarizing it while conserving the overall meaning. 

The purpose is to present a shorter version of the original text while preserving the semantics.

This project is designed to automate the summary generation process for large documents using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The core of the project is built upon the concept of sentence similarity and text ranking to determine the most significant sentences within a document.
